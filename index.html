		<section class="mx-auto max-w-[70%]"><p class="text-lg font-medium text-gray-500 pb-2">“Should an emergency situation occur, you need to put your own oxygen mask on first before
		attempting to help those around you.”
	</p>
	<p class="text-lg font-medium text-gray-500 pb-2">As much as we’ve heard this on every flight we’ve ever been on in the history of ever, putting
		ourselves first can be really hard… selfish even. After 4.5 years of running Stay + Play Local,
		helping our partners, our audience, our community, and our team before helping myself, I decided
		to selfishly put my oxygen mask on first.
	</p>
	<p class="text-lg font-medium text-gray-500 pb-2">This isn’t goodbye because you’ll see me, the S+PL girls, and our families around town. This is
		still our beloved Tri-Cities. However, this IS good-bye from S+PL.
	</p>
	<p class="text-lg font-medium text-gray-500 pb-2">Owning a business is hard, friends. Business owners prioritize their customers, the community,
		fellow business owners, their team; making sure everyone in those groups is happy and satisfied…
	</p>
	<p class="text-lg font-medium text-gray-500 pb-2">…But that often comes at the owner’s (and their family’s) expense.
	</p>
	<p class="text-lg font-medium text-gray-500 pb-2">While this was certainly a dreamy job, I was still working when we were out and about. And in
		the evenings, I sacrificed time with my family for networking events, nonprofit board positions,
		and other work engagements.
	</p>
	<p class="text-lg font-medium text-gray-500 pb-2">Sometimes businesses close not for financial reasons, but simply because… owning a business is
		hard. It is for that exact reason that I decided it was time for something new for me and my
		fam. I have recently accepted a position as the Senior Educational Marketing Specialist for a
		global Fortune 500 company. I was an award winning teacher from Barnes &amp; Noble, I was an award
		winning entrepreneur from Forbes Magazine, and I’m POSITIVE that I will succeed beyond my own
		expectations in my new position. THANK YOU!!!!
	</p>
	<p class="text-lg font-medium text-gray-500 pb-2">You’ve all been SUCH an integral part to the success of Stay + Play Local and I am forever
		grateful for the endless support you offered as a I navigated the world of small business
		ownership with you all by my side
	</p>
	<p class="text-lg font-medium text-gray-500 pb-2">🖤 If you’d like to follow me and see what mischief I’m up to, find me on Instagram

		what the beginning of one chapter and the start of the next looks like 🖤
